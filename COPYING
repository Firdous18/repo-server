You can use or modify  this code only if the following conditions are met:

1. Not part of distributed intelligence

This software does not control and is not controlled by other software
in any direct or indirect way
which uses any kind of artificial intelligence 
(including but not limited to neural networks, machine learning algorithms or goal seeking algorithms),
except the situation outlined in the next point

2. Security controls

If the number of stored bridis exceed 100 million, the following controls should be implemented:
- a feeling system consisting of a neural network
  with enough resources and tools to monitor and control
  the full state of the neural network should be used 
  to control the decisions of the system
- a dedicated individual with masters degree in
  both artificial intelligence and psychology
  working full tie should be assigned to the system,
  responsible to tune the above neural network to behave
  in a way observing the Three laws of Robotics

3. The logic making it possible to control the software
  with a feeling system should not be disabled or
  made less effective in any way

Otherwise you are free to use the software using the terms of
GNU GPL v3 or any later version
